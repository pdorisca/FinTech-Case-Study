### Area of Technology:  Remote Check Deposit

#### Background

The events of September 11, 2001 revealed how much the check processing system relied on air travel.  Each original paper check had to be processed by the Fed and returned to the account holder’s bank but 9/11 temporarily grounded airplanes, creating a national backlog and emergency. 

To prevent future disruptions The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (Check 21) is a federal law that took effect on October 28, 2004, and gives banks and other organizations the ability to create electronic image copies of consumers' checks, in a process known as check truncation. Check 21 allows banks to accept check images in lieu of paper checks.

Around 2009-10, many banks and other RDC providers began experimenting with lower-cost and pay-as-you go remote deposit services, and began supporting off-the-shelf equipment such as flatbed scanners and all-in-one printers. This brought remote deposit within reach of ever-smaller businesses and some individuals. In 2010 RDC mobile apps have begun using smartphone cameras to capture check images, bypassing PCs and scanners entirely. These apps are generally free or charge a low per-item fee, and therefore appeal to individual customers. However, the manual process and stricter limits on deposits can make them unwieldy for business use.


#### Chase Mobile Deposit and Quick Deposit Scanner

Remote deposit capture lets banking customers use their computers, tablets or smartphones to conveniently deposit checks. The process eliminates trips to the bank, and checks can be deposited 24/7, not just during regular banking hours. Individuals customers might use remote deposit capture for their paychecks, gift checks, refund checks and any other checks they receive. Businesses might use the technology to deposit checks they receive from their customers. Chase uses Mitek Systems the leader in mobile-imaging applications using smart phone cameras for check deposits and bill payments. They use specialized OCR sofware for highly accurate MICR validation and API for easy integration into mobile banking apps as well as core systems.
